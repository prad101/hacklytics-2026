This project is designed to address the urgent and multifaceted needs of women and girls in Albania who are at heightened risk of violence due to a variety of intersecting factors,
including gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, HIV status, experiences of trafficking, sex work, race, ethnicity, minority status, displacement, and LBT (Lesbian, Bisexual,
and Transgender) identities. Despite ongoing efforts to combat violence and promote gender equality, women and girls in Albania continue to face pervasive discrimination and
violence, with LBT individuals particularly vulnerable due to societal stigmatization, discrimination, and institutional violence. In a territory locally administered by 61 municipalities and a population of over 2.8 million inhabitants, the country has only 11 shelters (9 of them are emergency shelters) that offer specialized support to survivors of domestic violence; while only 5 of them are NGO-run shelters . The shelter “Streha LGBTI” is the only shelter in western Balkan who provide direct support including LBT women and girls, survivors of violence. The existing services are limited in providing rehabilitation and reintegration services, especially those focused on rehabilitation and empowerment of cases. The current
support provided by the state to some shelters (cover approx. 20-30 % of the total budged of the shelter per year) is inadequate, failing to meet the full spectrum of client needs and
contributing to concerns about staff resilience, especially during crises such as earthquakes, health emergencies, and other disruptions. Building on the successful collaborations
between the Center """"Shelter Edlira Haxhiymeri"""" and Streha Center, this project aims to enhance the resilience and capacity of these shelters to provide comprehensive, genderresponsive services to women and girls who have experienced violence, abuse, and discrimination. The project will offer a range of services, including safe accommodation, provision
of basic needs, medical assistance, psychosocial and psychological counseling, vocational training, and integration into the job market. These services are critical for the long-term
empowerment and reintegration of survivors, with support that can extend for up to three years in three municipalities Lezhe, Kurbin and Durres. The need for this project is
underscored by the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls in Albania, exacerbated by a deeply conservative and patriarchal society that often fails to protect
vulnerable populations. According to the Albanian Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) confirms what SEH experiences working directly with victims: • 52.9% of women aged 18-74 ‘ever’
experienced one or more of the five different types of violence during their lifetime; • 47.0% of women ‘ever’ experienced intimate partner domestic violence; • 65.8% of women ‘ever’
experienced dating violence; • 12.6% ‘ever’ experienced stalking. The number of domestic violence cases reported to the police has increased year by year, from 3.866 cases in 2015
è 5.064 cases in 2023 (State Police, 2023). The project's target groups include at least 150 women and girls who have survived violence, with a particular focus on LBT individuals,
those from minority ethnic groups, self-identified sex workers, and those living in poverty or rural areas. These groups are disproportionately affected by violence and discrimination
and often face multiple overlapping vulnerabilities that require specialized and tailored interventions. The project will adopt a gender-responsive, trauma-informed, and transformative
approach to service delivery, ensuring that the specific needs of each target group are met. This approach will involve: Comprehensive Service Provision, Capacity Building and
Resilience Strengthening, Expanding Geographic Coverage, Advocacy and Awareness-Raising: This project is not only a response to the immediate needs of survivors but also a
proactive effort to create systemic change in how Albania addresses violence against women and girls. The project aims to build a sustainable framework for prevention, support, and
empowerment through collaboration with state institutions, local organizations, and community stakeholders, ensuring all Albania's women and girls can live free from violence and fear.",66730,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Center Shelter Edlira Haxhiymeri,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,ALB,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-11-01,,,,,343741,27_21537,2025-05-14,2025-05-14

This project addresses the urgent needs of women forcibly displaced from Nagorno Karabakh (NK) to Armenia, who face multiple forms of violence and discrimination. The aftermath
of wars, blockades, and displacement has heightened their vulnerability, with many becoming primary caretakers for traumatized family members while struggling with their own postconflict trauma. Displaced women from NK grapple with intimate partner violence, violence by family members, societal discrimination, and structural violence. Their challenges are
compounded by discriminatory attitudes in local Armenian communities, impacting access to employment, education, healthcare, and social support. The project primarily targets
displaced women from NK, aged 18-65+, currently residing in Yerevan and six surrounding regions (Ararat, Kotayq, Gegharkunik, Shirak, Aragatsotn, Armavir) where most of the
displaced population has settled. Beneficiaries include those who have experienced psychological, physical, and economic violence due to recent conflicts and displacement. The
Women's Center Shushi NGO, led by displaced women from NK, brings firsthand knowledge and lived experience to the project. This unique perspective will shape genderresponsive policies for some of Armenia's most marginalized residents. Recent crises have exacerbated vulnerabilities in several ways: women who lost husbands face economic
challenges and exploitation risks; single women receive less state support, leading to precarious housing conditions; women with disabilities and elderly women struggle with isolation
and basic needs; women over 40 face employment discrimination due to sexism and ageism; and women in households with war-traumatized men are at higher risk of domestic
violence. To address these issues, the project will implement several interventions: Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Awareness-Raising and Capacity-Building Trainings; Individual
Psychological Support for GBV and Post-Conflict Trauma; Safe Spaces for Improved Wellbeing and Formation of Self-Help Groups; In-depth Research on the Situation of Displaced
Women in Armenia; and Advocacy Meetings with Ministry Representatives to Enhance Access to Essential Services. The project's goal is to enable women forcibly displaced from NK
and living in Armenia to effectively address and reduce violence within their families and communities. Expected outcomes include identification and solutions for multiple forms of
violence faced by displaced women; acknowledgment and understanding of displaced women's experiences by state bodies; improved access to safe spaces for healing from postconflict trauma; increased understanding of displaced women's issues within local Armenian communities; and improved social and economic integration of displaced women. This
project, led by one of the few women's organizations run by displaced NK women in Armenia, is crucial for addressing the specific forms of violence faced by this vulnerable

This project addresses the urgent needs of women forcibly displaced from Nagorno Karabakh (NK) to Armenia, who face multiple forms of violence and discrimination. The aftermath
of wars, blockades, and displacement has heightened their vulnerability, with many becoming primary caretakers for traumatized family members while struggling with their own postconflict trauma. Displaced women from NK grapple with intimate partner violence, violence by family members, societal discrimination, and structural violence. Their challenges are
compounded by discriminatory attitudes in local Armenian communities, impacting access to employment, education, healthcare, and social support. The project primarily targets
displaced women from NK, aged 18-65+, currently residing in Yerevan and six surrounding regions (Ararat, Kotayq, Gegharkunik, Shirak, Aragatsotn, Armavir) where most of the
displaced population has settled. Beneficiaries include those who have experienced psychological, physical, and economic violence due to recent conflicts and displacement. The
Women's Center Shushi NGO, led by displaced women from NK, brings firsthand knowledge and lived experience to the project. This unique perspective will shape genderresponsive policies for some of Armenia's most marginalized residents. Recent crises have exacerbated vulnerabilities in several ways: women who lost husbands face economic
challenges and exploitation risks; single women receive less state support, leading to precarious housing conditions; women with disabilities and elderly women struggle with isolation
and basic needs; women over 40 face employment discrimination due to sexism and ageism; and women in households with war-traumatized men are at higher risk of domestic
violence. To address these issues, the project will implement several interventions: Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Awareness-Raising and Capacity-Building Trainings; Individual
Psychological Support for GBV and Post-Conflict Trauma; Safe Spaces for Improved Wellbeing and Formation of Self-Help Groups; In-depth Research on the Situation of Displaced
Women in Armenia; and Advocacy Meetings with Ministry Representatives to Enhance Access to Essential Services. The project's goal is to enable women forcibly displaced from NK
and living in Armenia to effectively address and reduce violence within their families and communities. Expected outcomes include identification and solutions for multiple forms of
violence faced by displaced women; acknowledgment and understanding of displaced women's experiences by state bodies; improved access to safe spaces for healing from postconflict trauma; increased understanding of displaced women's issues within local Armenian communities; and improved social and economic integration of displaced women. This
project, led by one of the few women's organizations run by displaced NK women in Armenia, is crucial for addressing the specific forms of violence faced by this vulnerable
population. By combining direct support, research, and advocacy, it aims to create lasting change in the lives of displaced women and influence broader societal attitudes and
policies. The project requires $250,000 over four years to achieve its goals, covering Yerevan and six surrounding regions in Armenia",95877,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Women's Education for Advancement and Empowerment,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,BGD,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-31,,,,,343749,27_42421,2025-05-14,2025-05-14

The proposed project addresses the urgent need for effective interventions to combat gender-based violence (GBV) and discrimination against marginalized women and girls in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project arises from recognizing that systemic barriers and cultural norms perpetuate violence and discrimination, necessitating a multifaceted approach
that empowers individuals and communities. This initiative is critical in creating a safer environment for women and girls, especially those from intersecting marginalized backgrounds,
including ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and survivors of trafficking. Bosnia and Herzegovina has witnessed persistent gender-based violence, with significant gaps in
legal protections and support services for survivors. Reports indicate that approximately 48% of women experience some form of violence in their lifetime, with marginalized groups
facing even higher rates. The project seeks to address these disparities by implementing comprehensive strategies that foster awareness, provide legal support, and promote
economic empowerment. The primary beneficiaries of this project will be approximately 500 marginalized women and girls directly impacted by GBV in targeted communities. We will
also engage with 50 local women's groups and organizations to enhance outreach and support. At least 200 women and girls will participate in workshops focused on empowerment
and vocational training, with particular attention to those from intersecting marginalized backgrounds, ensuring that their unique challenges are recognized and addressed. The project
will employ a holistic approach that includes: Community Needs Assessments: Engaging local women's groups and community leaders to identify specific forms of violence.
Legislative Compliance Analysis: Reviewing existing legislation, identifying gaps, and proposing amendments to enhance legal protections for women. Capacity-Building Programs:
Developing gender sensitivity training for municipal officials and advocating gender-sensitive policies. Community Engagement and Education: Conducting workshops on recognizing
and preventing violence and integrating intersectionality education. Economic Empowerment Initiatives: Providing vocational training to equip marginalized women and girls with the
skills needed for sustainable employment. The project will be implemented in targeted areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in the Herzegovina-Neretva and West
Herzegovina Cantons, where rates of GBV are notably high and support services are limited. Collaboration with local municipalities will facilitate community-driven interventions and
ensure the project aligns with local needs. The project budget is 248,000 USD. The expected outcomes of the project include: Legislative Amendments: Proposing changes to existing
laws to improve protections for marginalized women and girls. Increased Awareness: Enhancing understanding of intersectionality among legal professionals, institutional
stakeholders, and community members, leading to attitudinal shifts. Improved Institutional Capacity: Strengthening the ability of local authorities and civil society organizations to
respond effectively to GBV. Empowered Communities: Fostering a supportive environment that rejects violence and discrimination, with 200 women and girls empowered through
vocational training and community engagement initiatives. This project aims to prevent and eliminate violence against women by addressing the root causes of GBV through
legislative reform, community education, and economic empowerment. By working closely with marginalized women and girls, particularly those affected by the crisis, the project will
ensure their voices are heard, and their needs are prioritized. Engaging local CSOs, INGOs, and government bodies will further strengthen advocacy efforts, leading to sustainable
changes in the legal and social landscape that affect women’s rights. Through this comprehensive approach, the project not only seeks to mitigate the immediate risks of violence but also aims to build a resilient community that actively supports the rights and dignity of all women and girls.",56985,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Žene za žene – Udruženje žena BiH,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,BIH,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-30,,,,,343950,27_42852,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

2026-01-13,2025,"For many years, the Republic of Croatia has supported international efforts aimed at alleviating the humanitarian consequences of protracted crises, including the situation in Western Sahara. The conflict, which has been ongoing since 1975, following the withdrawal of the Kingdom of Spain from the region, has resulted in a large wave of population displacement and the permanent accommodation of approximately 133,000 refugees in the Tindouf refugee camp in the southwest of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. The camp was established and maintained in cooperation with the Algerian authorities and the World Food Programme (WFP), with the presence of the United Nations Mission MINURSO, whose task is to monitor the ceasefire and maintain stability in the Western Sahara region.

For decades, the residents of Tindouf camp have been solely dependent on humanitarian aid, primarily food, medicine and basic necessities provided by WFP. Given the challenging climate, limited local resources and isolated location, maintaining a stable supply is a constant challenge. The European Union is the largest donor of this WFP humanitarian program, with more than 100 million euros in funds secured so far.

The Republic of Croatia participates in the MINURSO mission with five members of the Armed Forces and thus ranks among the countries that contribute to the stability of the Western Sahara, and sending a contribution to the WFP for activities in the Tindouf camp would represent a continuation of its previous involvement.

2025-05-21,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
In Ghana, entrenched cultural beliefs and patriarchal norms contribute to a harsh reality for many women and girls. Witchcraft accusations and intimate partner violence (IPV) and
systemic marginalization continue to deprive women of their safety, dignity, and rights. Recent studies paint a grim picture: Owusu (2023) highlights the rarity of defamation lawsuits
against witchcraft accusations, while Eboiyehi (2017) reports that over 1,000 older women in northern Ghana suffer banishment to """"witch camps,"""" often under dire conditions. The
2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) further reveals alarming rates of IPV, particularly in the Savannah Region (53.4%) and the Central Region (44.0%). Witchcraft
accusations in Ghana result not only in the ostracization and physical violence against the accused but also in severe stigmatization and, in some cases, fatal outcomes. In a recent
study by Songtaba titled """"Prevalence of Depression, Quality of Life, and the Gender Dynamics of Women Accused of Witchcraft in Ghana"""", it was found that 52.7% of women accused
of witchcraft suffer from depression, while over 97% experience an extremely low quality of life, as measured by World Health Organization standards (Adam et al., 2022). Regarding
intimate partner violence (IPV), the Ghana 2019 Human Rights Report highlights a troubling statistic: of the 264 rape and assault cases brought to court in 2015, only 17 resulted in
convictions. The project seeks to tackle the pervasive nature of intimate partner violence (IPV), accusation and banishment of women alleged to be “witches”, lack of economic
empowerment due to the patriarchal nature of the society which traps women in cycles of abuse and severely limits their access to essential support and justice. These
interconnected forms of violence inflict severe harm on the lives of women and girls primarily because of the lack and /or weak implementation and enforcement of legislations
including the anti-witchcraft law and the Domestic Violence Act, 2007 (Act 732) inter alia. The project aims to reduce violence against women and girls by ensuring 90% of survivors
have access to comprehensive support services, ultimately creating a society where women live free from fear and discrimination. To achieve this, • We will establish and pilot safe
shelters and one-stop centers offering psychosocial counseling, healthcare, and legal assistance for survivors of witchcraft accusation and IPV. These centers will streamline access
to comprehensive support, and we will advocate for their adoption as a sustainable national model. • Additionally, the project will also lead community engagement and awareness
campaigns, using survivor champions and influencers to challenge harmful norms and support the reintegration of GBV survivors. By collaborating with traditional authorities, we aim
to shift attitudes toward gender equality and create lasting support networks. • Thirdly, we will promote economic independence by providing vocational training for out-of-school girls,
mainly grandchildren of women accused of witchcraft, and offer entrepreneurship support for IPV survivors and accused women to help break cycles of violence and poverty. • Finally,
we will advocate for policy reforms, particularly the passage of the stalled Anti-Witchcraft Bill. We will also advocate for the full operationalization of the Domestic Violence and Mental
Health Funds. This project seeks to target 2,100 direct beneficiary vulnerable women and young women specifically, 500 number of old women accused of witchcraft, 300 number of
girls who are members of the families of old women, 1300 number of women survivors of IPV and 400 service providers being secondary beneficiaries and 12,500 indirect
beneficiaries in rural communities across 7 geographical districts in Northern and Coastal Ghana. This will include Northern (Yendi, Gushegu, Nanumba), Northeast (East Mamprusi)
and savannah regions, as well as the Coastal regions (specifically ada-foah). It is instructive to mention that these communities are fraught with inadequate and /or lack of
infrastructure, security, health and legal services, and social support systems, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of women and girls. Project success will be measured through a robust
monitoring and evaluation framework, including baseline and endline surveys, regular progress reports, and external evaluations. Songtaba, as the lead consortium member, along
with co-implementing partners; Renel Ghana Foundation will adopt an integrated approach using tested models and innovations such as Rights-Based Approach to address these
challenges.

The proposed project by Help & Shelter addresses critical gaps in support for women experiencing gender-based violence (GBV) in regions 5 and 6, Berbice, Guyana. Given the high
prevalence of violence—evidenced by a semi-structured survey revealing that 52% of respondents witnessed or experienced GBV—this intervention is not just necessary; it is urgent.
Our aim is to provide comprehensive support and empower marginalized women, particularly those who have faced intersecting forms of discrimination. This project adds significant
value by expanding access to psychosocial support and education for GBV survivors. It specifically targets the following needs: lack access to trauma-informed care for marginalized
women and girls which is essential for their recovery and empowerment, training for essential service providers including police and health professionals to respond effectively to GBV
and support survivors appropriately, increased education around GBV and its impact, alongside advocacy for survivors' rights and skills training for marginalized women and to advance economic empowerment which will help them escape abusive situations. The project aims to reach 1,120 marginalized women and girls aged 18-59 from diverse
backgrounds including survivors of violence, women with disabilities who face additional barriers to support and empowerment, women in low-income groups struggling with economic
dependency and lack of resources and women human rights defenders who are advocating for change but needing additional support and resources. Additionally, we will engage 800
secondary beneficiaries including health professionals, educators, community leaders, men and boys, family members, and police officers, to create a more supportive environment
for marginalized women and girls. To tackle specific forms of violence and discrimination, the project will implement GBV capacity-building training for service providers, community
leaders, and faith-based organizations on prevention, reporting, and referral systems for GBV, offer face-to-face and hotline counseling for marginalized women ensuring timely
referrals for additional support, equip community focal points with skills to provide initial support and guidance for survivors, conduct educational awareness sessions on effective
parenting, GBV prevention and response among other relative areas in various community settings, producing and sharing Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
materials to raise awareness and promote community engagement in reducing GBV and partnering with local organizations to provide training in marketable skills such as computer
literacy, cake decorating, sewing, and blockmaking. The project will be implemented in Canje and New Amsterdam in Region 6 along with services extending to surrounding
communities in West Berbice, Region 5. This area has been identified as having a high demand for GBV support services, particularly following community feedback indicating
significant need. The overall goal of the project is to ensure that women aged 18-59 in Berbice receive comprehensive and enhanced services for GBV and other rights violations
through a robust advocacy, education, and empowerment program by October 2028. The expected results anticipated following project implementation are improved response of essential service providers to survivors of GBV and other individuals at risk of GBV, increased access to trauma-informed counselling, referrals and other psychosocial follow-up services for survivors and individuals at risk of GBV ; enhanced capacity of community focal points to respond to disclosures of GBV violations and offer appropriate options to
survivors ; strengthened advocacy for the promotion of the rights of women and other vulnerable populations; heightened awareness of violations against women and girls and
strategies employed to combat all forms of violence and boosted employable and marketable knowledge and skills of women survivors of violence contribute to empowerment and
advancement in their daily lives. The total cost of the proposed project is USD 250,001. In conclusion, this intervention is essential not only to expand Help & Shelter’s services but
also to create a foundation for community empowerment, enabling marginalized women to overcome trauma and rebuild their lives. By addressing the systemic barriers they face, we
aim to foster a culture of support and resilience in regions 5 and 6, Berbice.",51542,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,Venezuela Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) 2026,RREG26b,1525,Help and Shelter,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,GUY,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-11-08,,,,,343964,27_42339,2025-05-21,2026-01-23
2025-05-21,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
The Eight and Nine project is designed to strengthen stakeholders’ response to sexual violence perpetrated against indigenous women and girls in Regions’ 8 and 9 through a multidisciplinary and grassroots approach. At the systems/multi-disciplinary level, the project will establish multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) comprised of State first-responders such as
police, health services, and social services officers, and civil society stakeholders such as village council leaders and community-based counsellors. ChildLinK will coordinate the
establishment of the MDT to strengthen efforts in responding to gender-based violence (GBV) including intimate partner violence, but particularly sexual abuse, against indigenous
women and girls in six (6) hinterland communities: Paramakatoi, Chenapow, and Kato in Region 8; and Aishalton, Annai, and Karasabai in Region 9. Grassroots response to sexual
abuse will be strengthened by training 30 women from the six target communities to operate the Child Advocacy Centre (CAC) satellite sites where girls and women who are survivors
of sexual abuse can receive community-based psychosocial support. Currently these services do not exist in these target communities. ChildLinK established CACs in the city of
Regions 8 & 9. The satellite sites will advance these services in six remote communities of these two Regions. Additionally, the trained women will also engage in sensitization
sessions to promote increased reporting and positive social norms to prevent sexual abuse. Women survivors of GBV will be supported to make reports against sex offenders and
receive counselling from the CAC satellite sites. Women and girls, whose cases progress to court during the project implementation period, will benefit from court support services.
ChildLinK will also lobby for increased stakeholder commitment from the regional administration for justice for indigenous women and girls who were sexually abused. ChildLinK will
engage public prosecutions department, public security, and the judiciary to direct additional resources to strengthen prosecution of sexual violence in Regions 8 and 9 to strengthen
the response to GBV and sexual abuse in two of Guyana’s hardest to reach Regions. Guyana’s indigenous peoples, the Amerindians, reside in remote communities in hinterland
regions such as Regions 8 and 9. Generally, Amerindians adhere to many of their ancient traditional, cultural practices, that are not valued or understood by the general Guyanese
public. Amerindian values and customs do not align with post-modern norms and values that are shared by the majority of Guyana's population. Consequently, Amerindians are
stigmatized and viewed as uneducated and gullible. Amerindian women and girls are viewed as ‘exotic’; this makes them targets for sexual abuse within and without their
communities as well as making them vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The vulnerability is compounded by the level of poverty in the target regions and a lack of access to adequate
social welfare services. The high rates of poverty due to limited commercial activities in the Regions and the lack of knowledge of children’s and women’s rights, results in high levels
of sexual grooming, sexual abuse, statutory rape, and sexual exploitation. The CAC satellite sites will add significant value to the lives of Amerindian women and girls in Regions 8
and 9. Women and girls will access psychosocial support services, which is not currently accessible in the target communities. Women and girls will also be sensitized on their rights
in an effort to reduce harmful social norms that contribute to GBV and sexual abuse. MDT members will be trained to strengthen response services from their agencies (police, social
welfare, health care, Toshao council, civil society) to women in the target communities. Sensitization sessions will promote gender equality and the importance of education, to
empower girls to increase their access to education and subsequent economic opportunities – therefore, Eight and Nine project will contribute to the fight against poverty among
Amerindian women. A baseline survey will be conducted to assess the experiences of Amerindian women and girls in these two regions, their exposure and experiences with GBV,
sexual violence and other influencing factors that hinders their safety and development. The findings of this study will be used to identify key indicators for change through this project
and as well as content for a national public education campaign to lobby local authority decision-makers for increased investment in Amerindian women and girls in Regions 8 and 9
while also dispelling stigma against Amerindian women and girls by promoting their rights to equal access to opportunities and highlighting their potential to contribute to Guyana’s
development. The project financing will cost costs for training, equipment, baseline survey, staff and overhead costs, capacity strengthening, auditing and monitoring and evaluation to

The consortium will work with women living with HIV, women survivors of GBV, female sex workers, child victims of violence, and women of diverse genders and sexuality
(transgender and lesbian women); these groups are very vulnerable to violence, stigma, and discrimination. In one of these groups, victims of violence are very likely to experience
more than one form of violence, such as physical and psychological violence, economic neglect, being left by a partner, losing custody of children, and not receiving legal assistance
for cases experienced. The situation of violence against women with HIV, women and children’s survivors of violence, female sex workers, and gender diversity is influenced by
several situations and conditions of victims such as poverty, low education, large numbers of children, minimal natural resources, not having sufficient access to information on
violence services, not having social security, strong stigma, discrimination, and patriarchal culture contribute significantly to the problems of women's issues in Indonesia. In addition, In addition,
the identity background of this group makes them even more vulnerable to experiencing multiple layers of gender-based violence. This group has many challenges or difficulties
accessing comprehensive and integrated services ranging from handling to victim recovery. Integrated services needed by victims include violence services, health, safe houses, free
post-mortem, psycho-social services, education, living assistance, economic empowerment, etc., justice when experiencing violence both against services organized by the
government and by civil society organizations, the group also has difficulty getting access to integrated violence services according to the needs of victims. This project aims to
encourage the establishment of integrated violence and health services for women survivors of violence, female sex workers, women living with HIV, and women of diverse gender
and sexuality (lesbians and trans women?) who experience Gender Based Violence (GBV) to realize access to transformative justice. Access to violence services that include
complaints, psychosocial, legal, health, and shelter services can be fulfilled for women from these vulnerable groups. We will work intensely with the stakeholders and decisionmakers at the national level such as the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, the Ministry of Health, the National Commission on Violence against Women, and the
NGO network in the GBV and Health Issues specially HIV. in the local level, we will work with the district office of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, health district office,
Regional Technical Implementation Unit for the Protection of Women and Children (UPTD PPA), hospital and public health office, legal aid organization, Local NGO and communitybased organization. Goal Project: Women and girls in Indonesia, especially those in vulnerable groups, have their rights improved as victims of violence through high-quality
integrated services for handling violence against women. With three main results: 1. Improve the acceptance and support from the community, government, and service providers of
violence towards groups of women with HIV, female sex workers, women with diverse gender and sexuality, and female survivors of gender-based violence who will be intervened in
this program in selected provinces in Indonesia. 2. Improve the awareness of women with HIV, female sex workers, women with diverse gender and sexuality and female survivors of
gender-based violence by reporting violence to service providers at the community level or violence services established by the community or government in selected provinces in
Indonesia. 3. Improve access for women with HIV, female sex workers, women with diverse gender and sexuality, and female survivors of gender-based violence to complaint
services, legal services, health, psychological strengthening, safe houses, and rehabilitation in violence services through integrated services established by the government in
selected provinces in Indonesia.

Context: In the aftermath of Myanmar’s 2021 military coup, the country has experienced one of the most intense civil wars within its borders, deepening the refugee crisis in South Asia, with India
becoming a primary destination. The UNHCR estimates that more than 60,000 refugees (unofficial figures go up to 100,000) from Myanmar have entered India since 2021 with a majority of them
being hosted in the north-eastern states of the country and New Delhi. Given that India is non-signatory to the Refugee Convention and lacks a domestic asylum law, refugees in the country find
themselves in a volatile protection environment with severely limited rights against detention, deportation and other violations. The recent security situation in the northeast has further
compounded the poor protection ecosystem for refugees. Under these circumstances, women and girls remain at their most vulnerable, caught in a cycle of sexual violence and exploitation, in their
home countries and throughout their displacement journeys. The UN has repeatedly highlighted the differential and devastating impact of this crisis on women and girls, who are at heightened risk of
rights violations. Target Population: As mentioned, the dramatic upheaval in Myanmar’s socio-economic and political structures has been catastrophic for its women and girls. Without legal pathways
to safety, refugees fleeing Myanmar, a majority of whom are women and children, have increasingly been forced to embark on dangerous routes to enter neighbouring countries in search of asylum,
often willing to risk facing trafficking, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), detention and deportation, and even death. Project Goal: The proposed project focuses on striking at the root cause
of the vulnerability of refugee women and girls from Myanmar—their lack of legal protection—which leaves them susceptible to severe forms of SGBV without any recourse to justice or redressal
systems. The idea is to spark a social movement towards justice, accountability, and peacebuilding led by refugee women themselves to mitigate their vulnerability to SGBV and to ensure the nonrecurrence of Conflict-related Sexual Violence (CRSV) while promoting truth-telling and reconciliation. The project has been designed in consultation with UNHCR India and its partners who are
currently working to meet the emergency post-conflict protection needs of the community. While these partners are focusing on emergency relief measures, they have highlighted the urgent need to
have a dedicated program to address the long-term needs of survivors or those at-risk of SGBV which includes the need for immediate access to - SGBV-specific counselling and medical assistance,
SRHR services, justice systems (including UN systems) to seek redressal for rights violations. Project Strategy: To this end, the project’s objective will be to build an inclusive and responsive legal
system for refugees. The project would adopt an integrated and multipronged approach aimed at: a) building capacities of community-based structures Refugee-led Organizations (RLOs) and civil
society organizations (CSOs) who will be familiarised on issues pertaining to refugee women/girls, applicable domestic laws and structures pertaining to SGBV, confidentiality protocols, traumainformed care, and documentation. b) establishing a referral pathway between the community and available institutional structures to facilitate better coordination of ongoing relief efforts and
respond to the heightened needs of refugee women/girls; and c) developing pathways for justice and accountability such that Burmese women have access to both domestic and international justice
systems for protection, relief and redressal for the violence faced by them in both in the home and host country. Geographical Coverage: The project will be implemented in States that are currently
hosting refugee communities in India. These primarily include, Mizoram, New Delhi, with smaller number of refugee groups being hosted by States including Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal
Pradesh. Please note that the geographical focus may change if the refugee community shifts base due to socio-political and economic factors. Further, please note that depending on the security
situation in the North Eastern region of India, the programme will be implemented strictly in compliance with government directives and advisory which may sometimes restrict access of civil society
in certain States. Budget: Regarding the resourcing plan, as mentioned in the detailed project budget, Ara expects the estimated cost of the proposed project to be roughly $809,000.",176287,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,The Ara Trust,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,IND,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-11-01,,,,,343972,27_21808,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

(Why:) This project addresses a critical and pervasive issue in Jordan, where 40% (of reported sexual harassment and exploitation incidents occur on public transportation.
Marginalized women, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who rely on public transit, are disproportionately affected due to their limited access to private
transportation and the prevailing lack of awareness and effective strategies to combat Violence Against Women and Girls (VAW/G). The pervasive culture of harassment,
compounded by societal norms that foster survivor-blaming, silence, and male entitlement, significantly undermines women's autonomy, freedom, and economic participation, thus
exacerbating Jordan's already low gender equality rankings. Moreover, the absence of a coordinated response among key stakeholders—including the Ministry of Transportation
(MoT), Land Transportation Regulatory Commission (LTRC), Greater Amman Municipality (GAM), and Public Security Directorate (PSD) in Amman and other governorates in Jordan
—has resulted in insufficient measures to ensure the safety of women in public transit. The need for comprehensive legal and regulatory reform, anti-harassment training, widespread
community awareness, and the creation of inclusive and gender-sensitive environments is both urgent and essential to counter this growing threat. The project feeds into the
implementation of the economic modernization vision and the engendered strategy for women’s empowerment. (Who:) The primary beneficiaries of this initiative are Jordanian,
Syrian, Palestinian and refugee women who endure sexual harassment and intimidation in the densely populated governorate of Amman, particularly those commuting to and from
governorates, industrial areas and key employment hubs. These women, often engaged in precarious work, are especially vulnerable due to their socioeconomic status, which
necessitates lengthy, overcrowded commutes where they face heightened risks of harassment. Secondary beneficiaries include essential stakeholders such as GAM, LTRC, PSD,
private transportation companies, and bus drivers in Amman, as well as male and adolescent commuters of various nationalities who also utilize public transportation. By adopting a
holistic approach, this project aims to create a safer and more equitable environment for all. (How:) This project will implement a comprehensive strategy to combat harassment in
public transportation through targeted partnerships and interventions. Collaborating with ten women-led Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) in Amman, the project will enhance
their capacity to empower women with knowledge and resources to report harassment and abuse in public transportation systems effectively. Preventative measures will be instituted
in collaboration with commuters, transportation operators, and relevant authorities. Through strategic partnerships with GAM and LTRC, JoWomenomics (JW) plans to introduce and
enforce anti-harassment policies, by-laws, and regulatory standards, mandating transportation operators to undergo anti-harassment training. The renewal of permits for privatelyowned mini-busses, which is annually, will be contingent upon drivers completing this training, and licensed buses will be required to display prominent anti-harassment messaging,
voicing explicit support for environments of safety, inclusion, and positive masculinity. Complementing these institutional and regulatory efforts, a community engagement campaign
will drive cultural change by promoting empathy, responsibility, and respect. Additionally, a mobile and web application will be developed to enable real-time reporting of harassment,
facilitate open dialogue on the issue, and help commuters navigate transportation systems with greater safety. JW will mange the app and through its FICRI, analysis will be
conducted. (Where:) The project will be implemented at the bus terminals in the Amman governorate, the economic heart of Jordan, which serves as a nexus for employment
opportunities and transportation networks connecting the broader region. Amman’s public and private bus services transport tens of thousands of workers daily from neighboring
governorates to various employment hubs. However, the overcrowded and often claustrophobic conditions of these vehicles create an environment ripe for harassment, exacerbated
by societal taboos that discourage reporting and accountability. (What:) The project seeks to achieve the following high-impact outcomes: 1. Empower women and girls who rely on
public transportation by providing comprehensive support mechanisms, including training, capacity-building programs, access to vital information and services, and tools to report
harassment and identify safe routes. 2. Forge robust institutional partnerships with key stakeholders, ensuring the enforcement of anti-harassment policies, practices, and regulations
within GAM, LTRC, PSD, and private transportation companies. 3. Enhance the expertise and capabilities of frontline staff on anti-harassment protocols, leading to a significant
reduction in sexual harassment incidents within public transportation systems. 4. Foster a societal shift in attitudes through widespread public awareness campaigns, media
engagement, and open dialogue, promoting a culture of respect, safety, and positive masculinity in public spaces.

Our organization proposes a 4-year project aimed at preventing and eliminating violence against women and girls with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan. With approximately 102,000 women
and girls with disabilities registered in the country, this vulnerable group often faces persecution and violence due to their intersecting marginalization. Our project focuses on working
with women and girls with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan, aged 18 to 65, from any ethnicity or socioeconomic background, who are survivors of various forms of violence, including
domestic, psychological, economic, and sexual violence. The project addresses a critical gap in support services, as women and girls with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan lack accessible
resources and face significant barriers in seeking help and justice when experiencing violence. The project will primarily benefit 280 women and girls with various disabilities, including
those who are blind, wheelchair users, and those with mild to moderate mental disabilities or developmental challenges. Also, 567 professionals, including law enforcement officers, healthcare workers, lawyers, and crisis center staff will be trained and educated to better serve this population. Indirect beneficiaries will include the participants' families, state and
private organizations, and the broader public through increased awareness and improved services. Our comprehensive approach includes three main components. First, we will focus
on building resilience and self-reliance through peer-to-peer counseling, life skills, violence prevention training, legal assistance, and informal professional training for economic
independence. We will also conduct summer schools of independent living to develop leadership skills among women with disabilities. Second, our capacity-building efforts will
involve training law enforcement, medical professionals, and lawyers to improve their understanding of disability and enhance their interactions with people with disabilities. We will
also work to improve staff skills at other women's crisis centers nationwide. Finally, our advocacy and reporting component will include the preparation of an alternative CEDAW report
to increase international attention on the issue of violence against women with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. The project will primarily operate from our Independent
Living Center in Bishkek, the only facility in Kyrgyzstan specifically adapted for women with various categories of disabilities. However, our outreach and training activities will extend
to five regions nationwide. We will also collaborate with partners in Kazakhstan for the summer schools, broadening our impact in the region. By the end of the project, we expect to
see improved self-reliance and resilience among women with disabilities, enhanced capacity of support services to assist this population, increased awareness and improved
responses from law enforcement and healthcare professionals, and greater accessibility of crisis centers for women with disabilities across Kyrgyzstan. Through these efforts, we aim
to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for women and girls with disabilities, reducing their vulnerability to violence and discrimination. The total cost for this
comprehensive 4-year project is $400,000, representing a significant investment in empowering and protecting women and girls with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan.",91409,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Public Association Union of People with Disabilities Ravenstvo,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,KGZ,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-29,,,,,343985,27_44450,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

2025-05-21,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
In Lebanon, both Lebanese and Syrian, confront significant challenges, discrimination, and violent abuse across various facets of their lives. These issues stem from deeply ingrained
social and cultural practices and persist in individual attitudes and beliefs. According to a UNDP report, gender bias in the region is considerably higher than the global average,
influencing both males and females (UNDP, 2020). These societal norms significantly impact women's roles as active contributors to the community, hindering their ability to achieve
freedom from violence and independence, including financial autonomy. As highlighted in a report by KAFA (2020), 53% of all cases of GBV in Lebanon are linked to economic duress
and the financial dependency of women. This creates a circle wherein the absence of women's economic participation amplifies GBV against them, simultaneously limiting their
access to GBV services due to financial constraints. In a context of political and economic crisis, compounded by the lingering effects of the Syrian crisis, Lebanon grapples with one
of the highest economic gender gaps globally, coupled with one of the lowest rates of women's participation in the labor market, as indicated by the World Economic Forum Gender
Gap report (2020). Women in the country face economic violence and financial dependency, exacerbated by the compounding crises of the collapsing economy, financial system,
political instability, societal disintegration, and the refugee crisis. The absence of governmental support, fragile social protection, and a lack of comprehensive women empowerment
interventions contribute to the deterioration of the status of Lebanese women (FSF, 2022). A partnership has been created to design and implement this project between 3 Women
Led Organizations(WLOs), HIMAYA DAEEM AATAA(HDA) Farah Social Foundation(FSF) and Sawa (SAWA for Development and Aid), the latter being also a refugee-led
organization. The proposed project aims at addressing violence against economically marginalized Syrian Refugees and Lebanese women and girls affected by the Lebanese crisis in
Central Bekaa/Bar elias, Taanayel, Zahle, Taalabaya ; North/ Tripoli- Zgharta-Mina-Tebbeneh-Jabal Mohsen; Akkar/Sahel akkar, Halba; Mount Lebanon/Chouf, Aley,
Baabda ;Beirut/Beirut through gender transformation and economic empowerment interventions, which will decrease the violence against women and girls. The project, for a total cost
of 600,000 USD, will be targeting 300 economically marginalized, Lebanese and Syrian, GBV survivors or at risk of GBV. The vulnerability selection criteria are as follow:
handicapped, widowed, single mothers, people with disabilities (PWD) and women heading their household who will be receiving vocational trainings and 4000 persons from the
communities where the project is implemented will receive sensitization on GBV and women’s rights. The vocational training topics will be based on the results of the gender-sensitive
labor market assessment conducted at the beginning of each cycle as well as a consultation with the targeted groups of women. Gender transformation approaches aim at working
with groups that integrate women and men to address gender roles, norms and power relations; this approach has a crucial effectiveness in similar complex contexts such as the
Lebanese one. Integrating men in this specific intervention (translated into awareness sessions in the proposed activities) will have higher efficiency than working solely with women
and will fundamentally change the gender relationships in highly patriarchal contexts such as the Lebanese context. On the other hand, empowering women economically will
significantly strengthen economic outcomes, decrease violence by taking them out of the home for periods of time and support the livelihoods of women; in which will result in
increasing the economic accessibility, and increasing the accessibility to GBV services among women. Accordingly, creating job opportunities for women through engaging them in the
private market a nd ensuring fair wages to foster financial independence and sustained decrease of violence against them. This project seeks to empower women and girls in both
Lebanese and Syrian communities across five key regions: North Lebanon, Akkar, Bekaa, Beirut and Mount Lebanon. While the direct target are women economically marginalized,
Lebanese and Syrian, GBV survivor or at risk of GBV., our project will also impact husbands, daughters, sons and men within their families as they will be a part of the circle of
change; we will design the sessions to highlight women's economic rights, aiming to increase their opportunities to access markets and sustain their livelihoods. In addition, 7% of the
target population includes people with disabilities, ensuring an inclusive approach to empowerment. By doing so, we aim to diminish discrimination, cultivate a supportive
environment, hence improve prevention of VAW through a multi-pronged approach that tackles social norms and behaviors, increase women’s access to skills and resources, and
improve their interpersonal skills",114895,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Himaya Daeem Aataa,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,LBN,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-11-01,,,,,343989,27_42089,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

El abuso sexual infantil es una de las violencias más invisibilizadas que viven niñas y mujeres. Muchas veces este tema no es hablado hasta la adultez. De acuerdo a datos de
INEGI (ENDIREH, 2021), 6.4 millones de mexicanas fueron víctimas de abuso sexual antes de los 15 años. En Chiapas, esto no es distinto, aunque no existan datos oficiales al
respect. El proyecto Mujeres poderosas busca mejorar la Calidad de vida y empoderar sobre la autonomía corporal a niñas y mujeres de 8 entornos escolares en San Cristóbal de
las Casas y 4 municipios de la región Altos. A lo largo de cuatro años se plantea la implementación de un Programa de Derechos con NNA enfocado en el fortalecimiento de
conocimientos para la prevención del abuso sexual infantil; talleres de sensibilización con madres y padres de familia; la implementación de un programa de formación de mujeres
indígenas replicadoras del programa de prevención en comunidades indígenas de municipios de los Altos; talleres de capacitación con docentes, profesionales del área de salud y
funcionarios públicos de dichos municipios para la prevención del abuso sexual infantil; contención emocional para casos identificados como prioritarios; y generación de una caja de
Herramientas culturalmente apropiada para la prevención y actuación asertiva ante casos de abuso sexual infantil. En total, se beneficiarán: 1500 NNA, 50 formadoras, 150 madres
de familias, 50 docentes y 50 funcionarios públicos, quienes participarán en el proceso. Al final del proyecto, se contribuirá a que niñas y mujeres estén empoderadas y fortalecidas
para la prevención del abuso sexual infantil. Nuestras estrategias se enfocan en la implementación de acciones a escalas escolares: Fortalecimiento de conocimientos de NNA;
fortalecimiento de conocimientos y capacidades con madres, padres de familia, docentes y funcionarios públicos para la prevención y actuación asertiva; la formación de
replicadoras para la implementación de acciones preventivas en comunidades indígenas de los Altos y la mejora de prácticas para la prevención a nivel entorno comunitario.
Utilizamos una metodología lúdica vivencial que facilita la generación de aprendizajes significativos y el abordaje de temas complejos con población infantil. Para llevar a cabo dicho
proceso hemos calculado los costes en 249,353.19 dólares. Se consideran los salarios de la coordinadora del proyecto, la asistente de coordinación y la persona encargada de
administración. Se considera también la contratación de consultoras para la implementación de algunas actividades, una psicóloga infantil, ilustradora e intérprete entre otros.
Existen los gastos de actividades como viáticos, impresión de materiales didácticos entre otros. En cuanto a los gastos como pequeña organización hemos considerado el pago de
servicios del despacho contable, telefonía e internet, el monitoreo y evaluación del proceso, buscaremos actividades adecuadas para el autocuidado así como alguna consultoría o
capacitación para el mejoramiento de capacidades y profesionalización dentro de la organización.",63172,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,Venezuela Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) 2026,RREG26b,1525,Infancia Común A.C.,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,MEX,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-30,,,,,343993,27_45042,2025-05-21,2026-01-23

La Ley para la Atención del Desplazamiento Interno en el Estado de Chiapas, promulgada en 2012, establece que las autoridades deben asegurar que los desplazados internos
vivan en condiciones satisfactorias, proporcionando alimentos, agua potable, alojamiento, ropa, servicios medicos, Saneamiento esencial y educación básica obligatoria. Sin
embargo, las instituciones gubernamentales, como la Secretaría de Protección Civil y el DIF, han realizado esfuerzos limitados, la atención médica que se proporciona está enfocada
en el tratamiento físico, sin abordar adecuadamente los riesgos de violencia psicológica y sexual que enfrentan la población desplazada. Estas instancias no han logrado coordinar
esfuerzos ni implementar intervenciones integrales e interinstitucionales. Además, entre la población, hay una falta de comprensión y sensibilidad hacia esta problemática. La
violencia contra las mujeres en contextos de crisis no es visible ni se ha discutido en el Consejo Estatal para la Atención Integral a la Población Desplazada Interna. Es por ello, que
con el proyecto se pretende mejorar la salud psicoemocional de mujeres y niñas desplazadas internas en dos regiones de Chiapas, México, garantizando su derecho a una vida libre
de violencia psicológica y sexual con un costo total de 25,0000.00 dólares en un periodo de 4 años. Se verán beneficiadas 250 mujeres (de 19 a 60 años) y 150 niñas (de 10 a 18
años) desplazadas internas y 170 personas de servicios de salud del primer y segundo nivel de atención. Para lograr el objetivo, se pretende tener los siguientes resultados:
Documentar a través de un diagnóstico los impactos de las violencias psicológica y sexual que las mujeres y las niñas desplazadas internas en dos regiones de Chiapas, así como
crear espacios de reflexión y diálogo metodología participativa feminista y que ellas implementen acciones de agencia, resistencia y autonomía contra la violencia psicológica y
sexual en su entorno. Durante estos procesos se estará proporcionando atención psicoemocional a las mujeres y niñas que lo requieran o soliciten por parte del equipo. Que las
unidades de salud brinden servicios integrales de atención médica y psicológica a mujeres desplazadas en situaciones de crisis por violencia psicológica y sexual en dos regiones de
Chiapas y mejoren su salud psicoemocional; a través de procesos de formación en derechos humanos desde una perspectiva interseccional, prevención de las violencias y atención
en crisis y conducción de situaciones de violencia psicológica y sexual en contextos de crisis, y la creación de un plan de atención integral con ruta crítica. Y el último resultado, sería
que la población general de estas regiones disminuya u omita actos de discriminación y estigma hacia mujeres y las niñas desplazadas internas en situaciones de crisis por violencia
psicológica y sexual, esto, a partir de una campaña de comunicación con pertinencia cultural. La campaña será enfocada en derechos humanos de las mujeres y niñas desplazadas
internas y los impactos de la violencia psicológica y sexual en la vida de las mujeres. La implementación del proyecto se llevará a cabo en coordinación y alianzas con
organizaciones de base en ambas regiones que tiene presencia y trabajo en el territorio, así como instancias de gobierno como Protección civil, DIF y dos distritos de salud.",56615,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,Venezuela Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) 2026,RREG26b,1525,Centro de Investigaciones en Salud de Comitán AC,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,MEX,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-29,,,,,343997,27_21771,2025-05-21,2026-01-23

Violence against women remains a significant challenge in Nepal as it is deeply intertwined with cultural, social and economic factors. These acts of violence deny women their basic
rights to safety, dignity and equality. Among the various forms of VAW prevalent in Nepal, the proposed project wants to focus on ending harmful practices of Taani Bibaha
(force/abduction marriage), child marriage and dowry, practices that are sustained and maintained by outdated social and cultural norms. These harmful cultural practices have
negative impact on women’s physical and mental health. Survivors often face long-term health problems, including physical injuries, chronic pain, mental health disorders and
reproductive health issues. The trauma can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder significantly affecting their overall well-being and quality of life. According to
NDHS 2022, 11% and 22% of population exhibits symptoms of anxiety depression respectively, with a significant number of these individual being women. Despite being outlawed, these practices persist in many rural and conservative communities in Nepal. These harmful practices perpetuate gender inequality, hinder economic development and violate basic
human rights. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that include not only legal reforms but also education and awareness, community engagement and the
empowerment of women and girls. Currently local government are mandated to address GBV and support survivors of GBV. They are also influenced by strong ties with their local
community into not enforcing it. Rather in many incidences, they have been known to strengthen traditional values and discriminatory socio-cultural norms and practices such as by
coercing survivors into compromising with or shielding the perpetrators in the name of protecting tradition. This leaves the survivors and other women and girls vulnerable to
continued threat of violence, exploitation and abuse. Our proposed project goal will be to ensure “Women and girls in targeted district enjoy and live improved and peaceful lives free
from violence, particularly forced (abduction) marriage, early and child marriage and dowry related violence.” For this proposed project, Mahila Bikash Sewa Kendra from Dhanusha,
Rauta Samudayik Bikash Kendra from Udayapur and Holistic Development Service from Rukum East will be our partner organizations. All three selected districts are known for high
number of cases of VAW/G. We plan to work with 120 women and girls (between 15 and 50 years of age) who are survivors of violence, especially of forced/abduction marriage
(Taani Bibaha), child marriage, and dowry related violence. We also intend to reach about 500 secondary beneficiaries (including family members, WHRDs, local CBOs, local
government representatives, Provincial Parliamentarians, traditional healers/leaders, priest etc.) to increase awareness on consequences of harmful cultural practices and mobilize
them as critical opinion makers to challenge harmful traditional practices responsible for VAW. Our proposed project will work for Madheshi women and girls from Dhanusha district,
Indigenous women and girls from Udayapur and Rukum East districts. Focus will be on women from the lowest income groups. We will cover Five municipalities in the three districts.
The proposed survivor-centric interventions aims to work with women and girls in the community. All measures to enable a safe and confidential environment for the survivors will be
adopted and ensured. We will reach out to stakeholders such as front-line/WHRDs, local CBOs, young men and boys by strengthening their capacities to prevent GBV by challenging
harmful traditional practices and effectively respond to cases of GBV. Similarly, engagement with the local government in municipality councils, especially judicial committees within
these councils will be another component of this project. Local government and their existing protection clusters will be strengthened by developing standard operating procedures,
mapping of services for response mechanism, advocacy for gender friendly budgeting, and resource mobilization. The set of proposed actions to change their situation (project’s
interventions, the how) • Enhance the capacity of women and young girls at the community to prevent and respond to GBV • Strengthen the GBV response, referral mechanism and
protection cluster at local level • Provide need-based support including Psychosocial counselling support, financial incentives, safe-house for rehabilitation, and skill training with
livelihood opportunities • Create and strengthen Men and boys’ network, capacity strengthening and conceptual clarity workshops to the network to take lead to address GBV and
create environment for social transformation. Overall, the planned interventions will bring together different actors creating environment for women to take lead in a Humanitarian
Partnership Platforms model which will better position their voice for collective action against GBV in local emergency response, preparedness and long-term planning. Our proposed
project costs are estimated at $ 290,000 USD.",75611,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Tarangini Foundation,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,NPL,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-11-05,,,,,344001,27_43138,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

Nepal ranked 106th in the Gender Inequality Index 2021 and 116th in the Gender Global Gap Index 2023. Women, particularly those in socially and economically marginalized and
remote areas, endure high rates of gender-based violence (GBV), with 57.7% reporting emotional (55.2%), physical (34%), and sexual (21.5%) violence over their lifetime (Puri et al.,
2015). Madhesh Province in Nepal has the highest Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index and the lowest Human Development Index where alarmingly, 41% of married women aged 15-49
experience physical, sexual, or emotional violence from their husbands, surpassing the national average of 29% (Nepal MICS 2019). Around 2.2% of Nepal's total population has
disabilities, with 2% of females and 2.5% of males experiencing some form of disability (CBS 2021). However, actual figures are likely to be higher considering that the WHO
estimates that 16% of the global population experiences significant disability (WHO 2023). Two out of three women and girls with disabilities (WGDs) in Nepal face a heightened risk of GBV. The lack of disability-inclusive GBV policies and services puts them at further risk of physical, verbal, and psychological abuse (NFDN 2019). NDWA research in 2020 found
women and girls with intellectual disabilities, autism, psychosocial disabilities, visual impairment, hearing impairment, severe physical disabilities, and multiple disabilities particularly
vulnerable to GVB. They face additional challenges in accessing justice and government services. A stakeholder consultation conducted by the NDWA in 2024 highlighted the existing
government services, including healthcare, security, the justice system, and policies, as inaccessible and insensitive to respond to the specific needs of WGDs and their access to
justice. Minors amongst WGDs are particularly vulnerable to violence and face further challenges when reporting and accessing services and justice, as they are not heard within their
families, communities, and governments due to age-based discrimination, lack of capacity, and discriminatory culture. The human rights capacity, particularly the rights of WGDs, is
limited among civil society organizations (CSOs), organizations of people with disabilities (OPDs), media, women human rights defenders (WHRDs), WGDs, and violence against
women and girls (VAWG) survivors with disabilities. Consequently, their advocacy against VAWG is marginal and less effective. In addition, the longstanding human rights issues,
including intersecting, and discrimination against WGDs in the private and public spheres make them more vulnerable to violence. The local policies, plans, programs, and
infrastructure are not inclusive from the perspectives of human rights and gender equality, disability, and social inclusion (GEDSI) due to the lack of capacity, resources, and
accountability of the local, provincial, and federal governments. The Inclusive Governance, Nurturing Independence, and Transforming Environments for Women and Girls with
Disabilities WGDs in Nepal (IGNITE) project aims to achieve the following goal and results. a. Goal: Women and girls with disabilities and VAWG survivors with disabilities live a
dignified life free from all forms of VAWG in the project municipalities of Madhesh Province by the end of the project. b. Targets: WGDs and VAWG survivors with disabilities among
WGDs. c. Results (i) Enhance the capacity of the governments and justice mechanisms, WHRDs, OPDs, media, community groups and networks, and other stakeholders, (ii) Make
the policies, programs, infrastructure, and services of the local governments and justice mechanisms GEDSI-inclusive and accessible for WGDs, and (iii) Increase access to justice
for VAWG survivors with disabilities. d. Main activities Capacity development, campaign, advocacy and lobbying, GEDSI/Accessibility Audits, laws and policy review, legal aid, logistic
and infrastructural support to the VAWG survivors with disabilities and the government and justice mechanisms, research and survey, information dissemination and awareness,
counseling, education & sensitization, knowledge management, and organizational capacity development. The priority focus of the project is on the access of WGDs to government
services and justice and protection. Thus, the main duty bearers for the project are municipalities, wards, and One-stop Crisis Management Centers (OCMCs) and justice
mechanisms such as judicial committees at the municipality and Women, Children and Senior Citizen Service Center (women cell) at the district police offices (DPOs). In addition, the
project’s collaboration with the local governments and justice mechanisms contributes to achieving the government’s commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
mainly Goal 5, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW). Project strategies: Community engagement, intersectional-driven, policy advocacy and negotiation, men and boys engagement strategy, community-to-international
linkage, and wider collaboration with stakeholders. Geographic coverage: 32 municipalities of all eight districts of Madhesh Province.

El proyecto de DEMUS trabajará con mujeres en su diversidad, además de personas ltbiq+ de distintos territorios del Perú, especialmente Lima Este, Tacna y Huánuco, en alianza
con colectivas de mujeres, feministas y lgtbiq+. DEMUS tiene un trabajo institucional con las colectivas feministas y activistas de estos territorios, además, reconoce cómo se
interseccionan las violencias que atraviesan las vidas de niñas, adolescentes, mujeres y personas ltbiq+ en su diversidad, por condición socioeconómica, identidad étnica,
orientación sexual e identidad de género y/o condición de discapacidad; por lo que con enfoques de género y derechos humanos, pero también interseccional, antirracista y
territorial, se contribuirá a la prevención primaria de la discriminación y la violencia de género. Se es consciente del insuficiente e incluso, inexistente trabajo que se ha desarrollado
en el país en materia de prevención primaria. Este proyecto desarrollará acciones orientadas al cambio en los valores y la cultura patriarcal, machista y heteronormativa, que permite
la discriminación y las desigualdades que afectan a niñas, adolescentes, mujeres y diversidades sexuales; especialmente en un contexto de arremetida de los grupos antiderechos
que ocupan espacios de toma de decisión e impiden y hasta incluso generan retrocesos en prevención primaria de la discriminación y VBG. Se plantean tres resultados: R1)
Colectivas feministas y ltbiq+ fortalecidas en sus capacidades de vigilancia e incidencia en estrategias comunitarias de prevención primaria para enfrentar la discriminación y la VBG
en sus territorios, R2) Activistas y colectivas feministas cuentan con evidencia y propuestas técnicas territoriales construidas participativamente para demandar y fortalecer las
políticas estatales de prevención primaria frente a la discriminación y violencia de género, R3) Tres territorios (Huánuco, Tacna y Lima Este) con entornos favorables para desmontar
prejuicios sexuales y estereotipos de género que perpetúan la discriminación y violencia de género, en particular las relacionadas al ejercicio de la autonomía de las mujeres en su
diversidad y las personas ltbiq+. Se emplearán estrategias múltiples: a) Fortalecimiento de capacidades a mujeres activistas organizadas y colectivas feministas y ltbiq+, que vienen
trabajando en sus territorios, b) Fortalecimiento de actoría social de las activistas a través de estrategias de vigilancia ciudadana novedosa en servicios de prevención primaria, que
trabajen la deconstrucción de prejuicios sexuales y estereotipos de género. c) Movilización social de las activistas y otros actores/as de los territorios para implementar estrategias
comunitarias de prevención primaria (artivismos, campañas comunicacionales, ciberactivismo) Con todo esto, Demus buscar como objetivo contribuir a desmontar patrones
socioculturales de género, machistas y sexistas, basados en los estereotipos sexuales y de género, que tienen una relación estrecha con los prejuicios sobre las mujeres y
diversidades sexuales; lo cual impacta negativamente en el ejercicio de su autonomía, además de sustentar la discriminación y las múltiples desigualdades. Se deben promover
agentes de cambios en los territorios para cuestionar pública y sostenidamente lo que permite y fomenta este sistema heteropatriarcal, legitimando mecanismos discriminatorios
como el uso de la violencia para controlar el cuerpo y el ejercicio de la sexualidad de las mujeres y personas ltbiq+. Esta propuesta tendrá un costo de 1 millón de dólares por 4 años

2025-05-14,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
RWDS and QADER have jointly developed a project to build on their longstanding experience in implementing similar interventions. RWDS aims to scale up the work initiated three
years ago through projects funded by CISU and Freida, a Swiss partner, emphasizing the importance of targeting single and divorced women, who are among the most marginalized
in the community. Through previous projects, RWDS recognized the significance of legal and media support as essential tools to influence attitudes, promote awareness, and support
women's rights, while also addressing the stigma surrounding these groups. Building on these learnings, RWDS prioritizes support for single and divorced women, enhancing legal
and media interventions to promote positive change in attitudes towards women's rights. QADER is building on the foundation laid by previous projects by extending support to
disabled women and children, recognizing them as some of the most marginalized segments, especially during wartime. This inclusion underscores the commitment to addressing the
needs of marginalized groups. The project also aims to tackle the multifaceted challenges faced by divorced/single mothers, including those caring for children with disabilities, and
women with disabilities aged 18-55 who are vulnerable to violence in rural areas of Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. Implemented in 15 marginalized rural communities, the project
addresses limited access to protection services, which is exacerbated by conservative settings lacking awareness and support, as well as Israeli measures that hinder access to
services, particularly impacting women with disabilities. The escalating violence in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since October 7 has significantly intensified protection
challenges for women and girls, particularly those with disabilities. In Gaza, the United Nations reports that over 1.4 million people, including women and children, have been
displaced, with many shelters overcrowded and lacking basic amenities, increasing the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and exploitation. According to UN Women, incidents of
domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of GBV have surged due to the breakdown of social structures and the scarcity of protection services. Women with disabilities
face even greater difficulties, as 92% of shelters and services in Gaza are inaccessible to them, according to Humanity & Inclusion. In the West Bank, particularly in areas
experiencing frequent military incursions and settler violence, women and girls face similar risks. Movement restrictions and widespread insecurity limit their access to essential
services. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that over 25% of Palestinian households are female-headed, making these women especially
vulnerable to poverty, violence, and social exclusion during times of conflict. The war has exacerbated an already inadequate protection infrastructure for women and girls in Gaza
and marginalized West Bank communities. Humanitarian assessments reveal a severe shortage of accessible shelters, psychosocial support, and legal assistance for GBV survivors.
The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) reports that 70% of GBV survivors in Gaza lack appropriate protection services, with women with disabilities disproportionately affected—only 5%
have access to necessary support. These statistics underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions for divorced and single mothers, women with disabilities, and those caring
for family members with disabilities. Thus, the demand for psychosocial support is critical, making the planned interventions of this project both highly needed and viable, especially in
Gaza. Leveraging their expertise, RWDS and QADER focus on empowering rural women, particularly divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities, through a Human RightsBased approach guided by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The project aims to raise awareness, provide skills, and empower right-holders,
emphasizing community mobilization, family engagement, and capacity-building for protection service providers. It seeks to challenge patriarchal norms, advocate for legal reforms,
and drive societal transformation to overcome barriers to women's empowerment. The outlined results align with the project's overarching goal: to enhance the safety and well-being
of divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities in the Southern West Bank and Gaza Strip. Outcome 1: Increased awareness and improved access to psychosocial, legal, and
economic empowerment services for divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities, including those at risk of violence in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. Outcome 2: Enhanced
public attitudes and behaviors to prevent violence against single/divorced mothers and women with disabilities in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza through youth-led campaigns.
Outcome 3: Enhanced legal procedures and practices to promote the protection of single/divorced women and women/girls with disabilities who are survivors or at risk of genderbased violence in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. A set of outputs and activities has been designed under each outcome.

La identificación de las violencias, la promoción de la salud mental, emocional y el acceso a información científica y de Calidad sobre sus cuerpos e identidades son herramientas
fundamentales para el fortalecimiento y empoderamiento de niñas y adolescentes. Esto les permite construir proyectos de vida integrales, promoviendo el reconocimiento de las
adolescentes y juventudes como sujetas de derecho facilitando su participación ciudadana en la exigencia de la garantía de sus derechos. Frente a este contexto la presente
propuesta de proyecto tiene como resultados esperados que las niñas, adolescentes y mujeres jóvenes disfruten de entornos libres de violencia y puedan desarrollar plenamente sus
planes de vida mediante estrategias y acciones adaptadas a sus necesidades. Que adquieran conocimientos sobre Educación Integral en Sexualidad desde un enfoque de derechos
humanos, diversidad y género para mejorar el autoestima y autovaloración saludable que promueve su autonomía progresiva para el alcance de sus proyectos de vida: que esten
acompañadas de plantas y referentes familiares con herramientas para la activación del sistema de protección de niñas, adolescentes y mujeres jóvenes que se encuentren en
situaciones de violencia Además de fortalecer espacios de participación política de las adolescentes y mujeres jóvenes organizaciones juveniles potenciando sus habilidades y
estrategias de protección física, emocional y digital para la incidencia sobre sus derechos humanos El proyecto comienza con un diagnóstico sobre la salud mental y los riesgos que
enfrentan las niñas y adolescentes, seguido de un mapeo de sus necesidades y prioridades. Con esta información, se desarrollarán metodologías lúdicas y participativas para la
Educación Integral en Sexualidad (EIS) con un enfoque en derechos humanos, diversidad y género, que se implementarán a través de un proceso formativo. Se realizará un mapeo
de servicios diferenciados en salud mental, sexual y reproductiva, junto con campañas informativas sobre estos servicios para adolescentes. Además, se capacitará a la planta
docente en primeros auxilios psicológicos con enfoque de género y derechos humanos, y se organizan ferias y espacios de convivencia para integrar a la comunidad educativa en el
sistema de protección. Se ofrecerán procesos formativos sobre gobernanza, gestión de recursos e incidencia para organizaciones de mujeres jóvenes, así como formación en
derechos humanos y contraloría social en temas de violencia de género. Finalmente, se elaborará y ejecutará un plan de protección integral feminista para las organizaciones del
asocio, se espera contar con más de 500 niñas, adolescentes y mujeres jóvenes beneficiarias directas.",62145,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Asociación de Jóvenes Feministas Ameyalli,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,SLV,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-30,,,,,343954,27_42247,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

The proposed project by Labris is a comprehensive initiative to prevent and address partner violence in same-sex partnerships of LBTQ women and ensure an adequate response
from competent authorities. The need for this project arises from a general lack of awareness of partner violence in same-sex relationships in the LBTQ women community and a lack
of sensitivity and support from state institutions, particularly in the context of Serbia. This project addresses these critical gaps through targeted interventions, focusing on the victims
and the broader institutional framework responsible for protecting their rights. LBTQ women in Serbia face significant challenges, including widespread discrimination, social
stigmatization, and limited access to support services. Partner violence is a pervasive issue within this community, yet it remains largely unreported due to fear, mistrust of authorities,
and the lack of tailored support services. The inadequate response from law enforcement and other relevant institutions further intensifies the vulnerability of LBTQ women, leaving
them without the necessary protection and support. This project is designed to address these critical issues by enhancing the capacity of LBTQ women to recognize and report
violence while simultaneously working to improve the responsiveness and sensitivity of state institutions. The primary beneficiaries of this project are LBTQ women and LBTQ women
survivors of partner violence across Serbia. These women, often marginalized and underserved, will receive direct support through educational activities and access to an SOS
hotline. All services and activities will be free of charge, ensuring accessibility for all LBTQ women regardless of class, race, or social status. The secondary beneficiaries include
representatives of state institutions such as the police, social work centers, the prosecutor’s office, civil society organizations (CSOs), human rights defenders, and activists. These
groups will be targeted through training sessions aimed at improving their understanding of LBTQ-specific issues and enhancing their capacity to respond effectively to cases of
partner violence. Labris will implement a multi-faceted approach to achieve the project’s objectives. Key interventions include Educational Activities: Workshops and training sessions
for LBTQ women focused on recognizing the signs of partner violence, understanding their rights, and learning how to report incidents safely and effectively. Capacity Building for
State Institutions: Training sessions for police officers, social workers, prosecutors, and other relevant stakeholders. Awareness-Raising Campaigns: Public campaigns aimed at
increasing awareness of LBTQ partner violence. These campaigns will target the general public and potential victims, to reduce stigma and encourage more survivors to come
forward. Research: Research to gather data on the prevalence and nature of LBTQ partner violence in Serbia. SOS Hotline: Establishing a dedicated hotline to provide immediate
support, guidance, and emotional assistance to survivors of LBTQ partner violence. The project will be implemented nationally, with activities taking place across various regions in
Serbia. While the headquarters of Labris is in Belgrade, the project will reach out to LBTQ women in multiple cities and rural areas, ensuring that the interventions are accessible to a
wide range of beneficiaries. The inclusion of the Local Networks for Prevention of Discrimination and Support for LGBTI Community, established in seven cities (Belgrade, Novi Sad,
Niš, Novi Pazar, Pancevo, Subotica, and Kragujevac), will be instrumental in decentralizing the project and ensuring broader geographic coverage. The expected outcomes of this
project are (1) Increased awareness and recognition of partner violence among LBTQ women, leading to a higher rate of reporting and seeking help and (2) Improved response and
support mechanisms for LBTQ women survivors within state institutions and civil society organizations. By working closely with both marginalized women and the institutions
responsible for their protection, Labris aims to create a safer and more inclusive environment where LBTQ women can live free from violence and discrimination. This four-year
project, with a budget of 240,000.00, aims to create long-term systemic change in the prevention and elimination of partner violence in LBTQ women relationships in Serbia.",53713,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Labris – Lesbian Human Rights Organization,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,SRB,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-31,,,,,344013,27_21285,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

Ce projet répond à une nécessité urgente : lutter contre les pratiques culturelles néfastes, telles que les enlèvements et les mariages forcés, qui perpétuent la violence basée sur le
genre dans la préfecture de Mo, au Togo, une localité enclavée située à 400 km au Nord de la capitale. Cette région de 60.000 habitants dont la moitié féminine est marquée par des
normes patriarcales profondément enracinées et un manque de systèmes de protection adéquats. En effet la préfecture est dominée par les groupes indigènes Moba et Peulhs qui
sont minoritaires au Togo ce qui entraine une marginalisation dans les systèmes de protection de l’état. Toutes ces raisons exposent les femmes et les filles à des risques accrus de
violence et de discrimination. Face à l'augmentation de l'extrémisme violent qui menace de renforcer les préjugés et pratiques socio-culturelles néfastes, il est crucial de renforcer la
résilience des femmes et des filles marginalisées en mettant en place des mécanismes de protection robustes et en modifiant les comportements sociaux. Les bénéficiaires
principaux du projet sont les 30% des femmes et filles qui ont moins de 24 ans qui ont un faible niveau de scolarité et vivent dans des familles à faible niveau de revenus y compris
celles qui vivent avec un handicap parce qu’elles sont exposées aux enlèvements, aux mariage précoces et forcés. Les bénéficiaires secondaires comprennent les femmes leaders,
les anciennes victimes, les autorités traditionnelles, les enseignants, les forces de l’ordre, et les personnels de santé et des services sociaux. Ces groupes ont été choisis pour leur
rôle clé en tant qu’agents de changement, responsables de sensibiliser la communauté, de soutenir les victimes, et de renforcer les systèmes communautaires de prévention et de
protection. Sur une période de quatre ans, les activités de sensibilisation s’étendront au-delà de ces bénéficiaires spécifiques pour atteindre 70 % de la population de la préfecture
pour un vrai changement de mentalité. Le projet adopte une approche multisectorielle et intersectionnelle pour combattre les violences basées sur le genre. L’approche
multisectorielle vise la mobilisation des acteurs de plusieurs secteurs d’intervention y compris les autorités traditionnelles, judiciaires, administratives et les femmes leaders pour lutter
contre les enlèvements et mariages précoces et forcés ainsi que d’autres violences basées sur le genre notamment les violences domestiques. L’approche intersectionnelle mobilise
ces acteurs multisectoriels afin de réduire les discriminations croisées qui permettent de perpétuer ces types de violences notamment la faible scolarité de la fille et le manque de voix
des femmes et des filles surtout celles vivant avec un handicap dans les instances communautaires. Cela permettra l’amélioration de la prévention des violences et l’accès des
femmes et des filles aux services multisectorielles essentiels sûrs et adequats. Les interventions principales comprennent l'organisation de séances de sensibilisation dans les
communautés pour éduquer sur les droits des femmes et les dangers des pratiques violentes. Elles incluent également le renforcement des capacités des acteurs locaux, tels que les
femmes leaders, les autorités traditionnelles, et les forces de l’ordre, afin de créer un réseau de protection et de soutien. De plus, des kiosques de soutien seront établis dans les
villages pour offrir des services de prévention et de prise en charge, incluant un soutien psychosocial et juridique. L’implication des survivantes dans les activités de sensibilisation et
de soutien renforce la résilience communautaire et assure une approche centrée sur les victimes. Pour un budget de 250.001 USD étalé sur quatre années le projet permettra d’avoir
un impact durable sur les filles de Mo en arrêtant les enlèvements et mariages précoces et forcés et réduisant les autres discriminations croisées telles que le faible taux de scolarité
et la faible représentation dans le leadership coutumier. Les résultats escomptés incluent une réduction significative des violences basées sur le genre, une transformation des
mentalités envers les droits des femmes, et un renforcement des capacités des acteurs locaux pour intervenir et protéger les victimes. En outre, le projet vise à améliorer la

Tanzania Women Cross-Party Platform is primarily committed to engage in advocating for meaningful inclusion of women in politics and governance position in Tanzania. The
commitment to specifically work on Girls and Women with disability is prompted by the fact that they are not considered as special group and therefore subject them to double
violence compared with women without disability. It is estimated that 16% of the world population is composed of people with disability, while 80% of them are found in the World
South in which Tanzania is included. (UN Women). In Tanzania more than 3.3 million people are estimated to live with a disability. It is also depicted that Women have higher disability
rates with 7.8% of the country's total population estimated to be women with disabilities against 5.7% men. Tanzania is implementing laws and policies. Election violence tends to
disproportionately affect women than men worldwide. While it is true that both men and women may be victims of election violence, the form of violence that women encounter is
distinctively different from that of men, and in turn, tends to jeopardize women’s political participation. This study sets out to investigate the barriers that women face in political
participation in the form of violence against women in elections (VAW-E) as candidates, as well as voters and propose actions and interventions to reduce and eliminate the identified
barriers. In Tanzania, a report on the Mapping and Analysis of 2010 Election-Related Incidents of Violence (2011) shows that compared to previous elections, three quarters of
respondents (66.8 percent) said the 2010 elections were either very violent or violent especially during the vote counting process and the declaration of results (UDSM 2011:17). Yet,
this study did not use gender-based definition of the election violence to capture the magnitude of the VAW-E in Tanzanian elections. However, the observed violence during the 2010
general elections provides an indication that incidents of violence against women did take place but were not systematically uncovered using conventional methods of election
observation and monitoring, It is evident that no analysis that was done to depict the plight of girls and women with disability in that situation. Prevalence of violence against women in
elections (VAW-E) during the 2015 general elections in Tanzania. 52% of women reached out by T-WCP monitoring reported spousal violence and 53% of women reported refraining
from voting due to fear of violence, lack of registration, or pressure from spouses. Out of 110 appointed women MP special seats, there are only two women with disability evidencing
marginalisation and exclusion. Tanzania has adopted and implementing a number of laws, policies and standards pertaining to people with disabilities, including their rights to
protective and decent work, vacation training and basic services. Unfortunately, despite the obligations as stipulated in 1977 Constitution and its amendments prohibit discrimination
against persons with disabilities, in practice and especially in the political and leadership sphere, there is no policy or guidelines developed to ensure inclusion of women and girls with
disability in politics and governance structure. It is therefore the Goal of this project to advocate for creation of safe and inclusive political landscape that empowers Tanzanian Girls
and Women survivors of violence and those at risk of intersectional GBV including women and girls with disability to engage in political processes without fear of violence or
exclusion. This project addresses the critical issue of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in Tanzanian politics, with a particular emphasis on marginalized groups, including
women and girls with disabilities, those facing racial discrimination, and women human rights defenders. The project will be implemented in 11 regions of Tanzania, which recorded
significant incidences of violence against women during 2015 general elections. To achieve its goal, the project will employ targeted interventions, through Legal Advocacy, training on
Gender-Based Violence and Political Participation; Capacity Building and Training; Media advocacy; Community Mobilization; Debate; Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms. The
expected results of this project include increased awareness on the importance of inclusive approach to political participation and specifically the rights to political participation of
women and girls with disabilities. By focusing on the marginalized groups and employing these strategies, this project will contribute significantly in raising awareness on the
importance of inclusive democracy and rights of Girls and Women with disability, and at the same time, contribute to the Tanzania national agenda of prevention and elimination of
violence against women. This project is planned to be accomplished by utilising a total of US$ 200,000 within for implementation year.",41093,UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women,Multilateral Organizations,,2024,2024,,,,Tanzania Women Cross-Party Platform,NGOs,Protection - Gender-Based Violence,TZA,,,,2026,2026,financial,Standard,Traditional aid,incoming,single,paid,2025-04-01,2024-10-31,,,,,344029,27_44089,2025-05-21,2025-05-21

The regions of Shinyanga and Mwanza in Tanzania are grappling with alarming rates of child sexual violence and early marriages, as evidenced by research from several sources.
The World Bank (2022), Women Fund Tanzania Trust (2023), Hakielimu (2024), and the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children Tanzania (2022) highlight that Shinyanga
reports the highest rates of child pregnancies at 34% and sexual violence at 59%, leading to over 500 girls dropping out of school annually. Mwanza also faces significant challenges,
with a 37% prevalence of child sexual violence, especially in rural areas like Misungwi, Nyida, and Didia, where child marriage and sexual violence disproportionately impact the least
educated and poorest girls. The Women Fund Tanzania Trust (2023) indicates that 61% of women aged 20-24 with no education and 39% with primary education were married or in a
union by age 18, compared to only 5% of women with secondary education or higher. In Mwanza and Shinyanga, marriage is often perceived as a means to protect girls from poverty and relieve families' economic burdens. In response, the Government of Tanzania, in collaboration with partners such as UN Women, developed the second national plan of action to
eliminate violence against women and children in May 2024. Despite ongoing efforts by several actors, including Tanzania’s second National Plan of Action to eliminate violence
against women and children (2024/2025-2028/2029). There remains a critical gap in enforcing the implementation of the NPA against VAWV in Tanzania, resources and focus gap
specifically in Nyida, Didia, and Misungwi administrative wards of Shinyanga and Mwanza, where these issues remain alarmingly prevalent. Our project will not only support the
implementation of this NPA against VAWC but also this project is designed to directly engage 1,540 adolescents and young girls under the age of 25, both girls living with disabilities
(approximately 590 adolescents and young girls living with disabilities and 950 adolescents and young girls without disabilities), and a total of 200 duty bearers. Indirectly, it aims to
reach 2,600 adolescents and young girls and 1,000 boys in the Nyida, Didia, and Misungwi wards across two regions namely Shinyanga and Mwanza region. The project aims to
employ a human-centered approach: All activities including inclusive Workshops are meant to be organized in an accessible manner such as venues that meet the needs of girls with
various disabilities, for instance, venue or school spaces with ramps, or venue with elevators, and accessible restrooms. 1. Conduct 36 inclusive workshops at 9 selected schools on
girls's fundamental rights,financial literacy and life skills. 2. Provide quality survivor-centered mental health and reproductive health support services in 9 selected schools. These
clinics visit each of the three wards quarterly and aim to reach approximately 1,270 adolescents and young girls over the course of the project. The clinics will offer accessible and
confidential sexual and reproductive health services. 3. Establish 9 girls chainbreakers clubs at 9 selected schools (3 clubs in each ward) 4. Organize bi-annual mentorship and
coaching sessions to 270 chainbreakers members. 5. Facilitate 16 community dialogues (4 each year) advocating for the protection and prevention of child abuse and violence
targeting 200 duty bearers. A total of 200 participants, including 40 local authorities, 80 teachers, 40 media and journalists, and other 40 key actors, police gender desk office, social
welfare, and health providers. 6. Conduct four physical educational campaign (one per year). 7. Conduct five online educational campaigns by girl chain breaker clubs. Conduct five
online educational campaigns and one physical each year in the 9 selected schools, involving a total of 3,600 students. Overall goal: To create a safer, more equitable environment
where a total of 1,540 most vulnerable and marginalized adolescent girls both living with disabilities and without in Shinyanga and Mwanza region can thrive, supported by behavior
change, enhanced community support, and access to tailored services by October 2028. Expected Outcomes 1. 1,540 adolescent girls (including 590 with disabilities) survivors of
violence and those at risk of intersectional GBV are empowered through improved resources, skills and capacities to protect themselves from violence and prevent VAW/G.. 2.

The ongoing full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine has disproportionately impacted women and girls who are survivors of violence and at risk of violence, intensifying their
vulnerability to GBV, sexual abuse, and limited access to essential humanitarian services. These women include single and young mothers, IDP women, LBT women, elderly women,
women with disabilities, and those who have lost their jobs due to the war. The war has led to an increase in GBV incidents and has also exacerbated mental health crises, with a
notable rise in depression, anxiety, and stress-induced chronic illnesses. The war has restricted the mobility of these women, as they are often primary caregivers for children, the
elderly, and disabled individuals. This limited mobility, especially in areas heavily affected by war, restricts their access to humanitarian aid and support services, leaving them in
precarious situations. Recognizing the urgent need for comprehensive support, this project seeks to enhance access to safe spaces, psychological care, and legal services for women
from marginalized groups in Ukraine. The necessity of this project stems from the severe and multifaceted impact of the war on marginalized women and girls. The escalation of GBV
and the deterioration of mental health among these groups highlight critical gaps in the current humanitarian response, particularly in providing safe environments and specialized
support services. This project will address these gaps by offering targeted interventions that respond to immediate needs and contribute to long-term stability and empowerment. The
primary beneficiaries of the project are approximately 10,000 non-unique event participants from marginalized groups and 6000 unique beneficiaries, including: Single and young
mothers IDP women LBT women Elderly women, Women with disabilities, Women who have lost their jobs due to the war. The project also engages key partners such as local
women’s organizations, community leaders, and healthcare providers, who will collaborate to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. The project tackles
specific forms of violence and discrimination against marginalized women and girls through a multifaceted approach: Shelters in the relatively safer regions of Lviv and Chernivtsi will
provide secure living environments for women in need of refuge. These shelters will offer physical safety and psychological and emotional support. A trauma-informed care model will
be implemented, with teams of trained mental health professionals delivering comprehensive psychological services. This includes individual therapy sessions, group counseling, and
peer support networks aimed at mitigating the effects of trauma and promoting mental well-being. The project will offer legal aid to women facing GBV, sexual violence, and
discrimination. This includes helping them navigate the legal system, preserve crucial evidence, and hold perpetrators accountable. Additionally, two training sessions will be
conducted for lawyers working with GBV victims to ensure a survivor-centered approach. The project will also facilitate community hubs in Zaporizhzhia and Vinnytsia, where women
can participate in self-care workshops, art therapy, fitness support training, and job search training. These activities will promote resilience, personal growth, and community bonding.
The geographic coverage of the project spans the western regions of Ukraine, particularly in Lviv and Chernivtsi regions, where the shelters will be established. Community hubs will
be developed in Zaporizhzhia and Vinnytsia, providing safe spaces for women to access support services and activities. The shelters in the rear cities of Ukraine, where there is
currently no threat of attack. The community hubs are located in the Vinnytsia region, which is located in the rear, and the Zaporizhzhia region, which is located in the east of Ukraine.
Although this region and the city of Zaporizhzhia are closer to the frontline than other locations, there are huge number of IDPs from the dangerous eastern regions live. The overall
goal of the project is to improve the safety, mental well-being, and economic stability of approximately 6,000 women and girls who are survivors of violence and at risk of violence over
four years. The expected results include: Primary beneficiaries Enhanced access to safe shelters and essential care for 480 women and girls. Improved psychological support for
1,600 individuals through 4,000 consultations. Increased legal support and rights protection for 1,200 women, with 2,000 legal consultations. Community support networks benefiting
at least 2,720 women and girls who are survivors of violence and at risk of violence through safe spaces and community activities. Secondary beneficiaries: service providers - 48
lawyers and psychologists, social workers, families and friends of the main beneficiaries (approx.4,000 people).

2025-05-21,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
Venezuela enfrenta un complejo contexto humanitario que impacta de manera desigual en mujeres y niñas. Según la ENCOVI 2023, casi el 70% de los hogares pobres son liderados
por mujeres que no trabajan debido a responsabilidades domésticas, reflejando profundas desigualdades de género. Estas mujeres están expuestas de forma desproporcionada a
Violencias basadas en Género (VbG) y Violencias Sexuales basadas en Género (VSbG), agravadas por factores socioculturales y la crisis institucional. A pesar de los esfuerzos
humanitarios, la financiación insuficiente ha llevado a una reducción del 50% de los servicios de respuesta a la VbG en comparación con 2023. Dada la intensificación de la crisis
post electoral, es urgente ampliar los servicios multisectoriales para prevenir, atender y acompañar en cuestiones de VbG. Se propone un proyecto para proteger y fortalecer a
mujeres y niñas afectadas por la crisis en Venezuela, priorizando aquellas en situación de riesgo, como desplazadas internas, en extrema pobreza o afectadas por la migración. El
proyecto se enfocará en los Valles del Tuy, estado Miranda, por la capacidad operativa de CEDESEX, la alta población desplazada y la grave situación de violencia y salud en la
región. Es esencial fortalecer la respuesta institucional para abordar eficazmente la VbG y otros desafíos en esta zona vulnerable. Es por ello que hemos diseñado un programa de
prevención, protección y acompañamiento con un enfoque de derechos humanos, transformador de género e interseccional, con miras al fortalecimiento de la capacidad resiliente
de las mujeres y niñas sobrevivientes o en riesgo de VbG y de sus comunidades, en la región de los Valles del Tuy, en los términos que se presentan a continuación. 1. Con miras a
lograr cambios perceptivos y de patrones, comportamientos y prácticas en favor del reconocimiento de los derechos de las mujeres y niñas, se prevé: (1.1) el desarrollo de
dinámicas comunitarias de sensibilización, a través de una metodología participativa con enfoque crítico-reflexivo transformador de género; y, (1.2) la formación, capacitación y
conformación de una red de lideresas comunitarias por los derechos de las mujeres y niñas, como estrategia para fortalecer su rol como agentes de cambio. 2. Para mejorar las
capacidades y aptitudes de las mujeres y niñas sobrevivientes o en riesgo de VbG con miras a su empoderamiento y autonomía personal, social y económica, se prevé: (2.1) el
establecimiento y dotación de 3 Espacios Seguros de Mujeres y Niñas (ESMN) que brinden recursos colectivos para el empoderamiento; y, (2.2) la formación y capacitación de las
mujeres participantes en los ESMN (inspiradas en la metodología del UNFPA). 3. En la búsqueda de la mejora de los servicios públicos para las mujeres y niñas sobrevivientes o en
riesgo de VbG, se prevé: (3.1) un programa de formación para instituciones del sistema de protección tanto de mujeres como de niños, niñas y adolescentes; (3.2) un programa de
capacitación a personal de salud, con miras a dejar capacidades instaladas para el manejo clínico de la violencia sexual, la colocación de métodos anticonceptivos e identificación de
signos de alarma obstétrica, entre otros; (3.3) la dotación de medicamentos para el manejo clínico de la violencia sexual en los mismos ambulatorios; y, (3.4) un programa de
capacitación de docentes en Educación Integral de la Sexualidad. 4. Con miras a ofrecer un acompañamiento integral, amoroso y transformador para hacer frente a la VCMN, se
prevé: (4.1) un programa de servicios multisectoriales para la atención en VbG, incorporando gestión de casos de VbG, atención psicosocial, asesoría legal e incluso, apoyos
materiales cuando sea necesario (4.2) atenciones en salud sexual y reproductiva, incluyendo tanto planificación familiar como control prenatal, a las mujeres atendidas en el
programa de servicios en VbG. Para esta intervención hemos presupuestado un costo de 249.654,48$ para alcanzar a: Total de Beneficiarios: 20.702 Mujeres y Niñas: 6.903

2025-05-21,,"Multi-Sector - GBV Programming
This project will be implemented in four selected districts in Zimbabwe namely, Mbire, Marange, Gokwe, and Beitbridge over 4 years . The overall goal of the project is “Marginalised
women and girl survivors of intersectional violence in 4 districts of Zimbabwe enjoy protection of GBV laws and policies by October 2028.” The project seeks to address the remaining
and perennial gaps in eliminating VAWG as well as complement and scale up efforts by the government, GBV stakeholders and institutions. These gaps include insufficient
implementation of the Domestic Violence Act Chapter 5:16 due to lack of accountability mechanisms, financial resources , unavailability of police posts and health centres . In rural
areas such as Mbire police stations are situated 20 km away from communities making police services unavailable to survivors of GBV Zimbabwe is currently gripling under the
effects of the 2023/24 El Nino induced drought which has resulted in crop failure, depletion of water sources, food insecurity and heightened poverty. As a result, women and girls’
exposure to sexual exploitation, GBV, intimate partner violence and child marriages has escalated. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by the protection consequences of
climate change and economic hardship. In the targeted geographical areas of Mbire, Gokwe and Beitbridge, women and girls are forced to walk long distances to collect water, facing
an increased risk of sexual violence. WLSA is currently implementing a project on ending child marriages in Chipinge, Mutasa and Mutare rural areas supported by Christian Aid . Our
learning from this project has shown that there are increased cases of child marriages, and GBV which were exacerbated by the El Nino . There are high rates of SGBV with one in
three women being affected. Harmful Practice, religious beliefs and patriarchy result in increased child marriages and GBV due to the religious doctrine of child marriages and position
of women and girls in white garment churches dominant in the areas. The specific groups targeted include Adolescent girls (9- 18 years), young women (18-35 years), women and
girls with disabilities, Women / girl survivors of violence, Women/girls from minority ethnic, apostolic sects, Women and girls in the lowest income groups who are, marginalized and
disadvantaged who live in rural, peri urban, mining and drought prone areas. These women and girls have been left out of development issues, and are socially, politically and
culturally marginalized. The women and girls across the four chosen districts, are at high risk of experiencing violence or are already affected by it. By focusing on marginalized
communities, the project seeks to empower women and girls through awareness programs, capacity building, and direct legal aid support services. Additionally, community leaders,
traditional leaders, youth , and men in the community will be engaged to foster a collective understanding of gender justice and equality, encouraging local community actions and
male voices in advocacy efforts to prevent VAWG. Implementation of this project will adopt the following strategies- a) Service delivery to women and girls who are survivors of
violence b) Coordination with local government , police , local leadership and other key stakeholders to enhance existing protection frameworks against GBV. c) Advocacy and policy
change dialogues and debates . d) Community engagement , awareness and empowerment on GBV , available services and legal recourse. e) Capacity building of dutybearers. This
project seeks to develop a robust training program for law enforcement agencies, government and community leaders on their respective constitutional obligations and duties to
VAWG. Through this training, WLSA aims to build collective and shared responsibilities , challenge the culture of silence , and the understanding of respective functionaries in curbing
VAWG . The project will allocate resources specifically for advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about available services and support mechanisms for survivors, thereby promoting
a culture of reporting and seeking help. The expected outcomes of this project are, we anticipate a significant reduction in the incidences of VAWG, SGBV, and child marriages within
the targeted districts, because of improved community awareness and engagement. Increased reporting of violence, coupled with better response mechanisms from local authorities,
will empower women and girls to seek justice and support, fostering a more inclusive environment. There will be strengthened partnerships between the women’s organizations ,
community institutions and government contributing to pronounced alignment of resources and interventions . By equipping local institutions with the knowledge and tools necessary,
a resilient framework that transcends the current funding limitations will be established.
